# LLM Evaluation Benchmarks Survey

## What do you want to build?

Write a comprehensive survey paper on LLM evaluation benchmarks in LaTeX format. The paper should provide a systematic taxonomy of existing benchmarks, comparative analysis of their methodologies, coverage analysis of evaluated capabilities, and meta-analysis of trends in LLM evaluation practices.

The research should:
- Survey 30-50 major LLM benchmarks (MMLU, HellaSwag, HumanEval, BigBench, etc.)
- Develop a taxonomy organizing benchmarks by: task type, evaluation metric, dataset construction method, and capability tested
- Analyze coverage gaps — what capabilities are under-evaluated or over-evaluated
- Conduct meta-analysis of correlation between benchmarks and their predictive value for downstream tasks
- Discuss limitations of current evaluation practices and propose future directions
- Use publicly available benchmark papers, datasets, and leaderboard data

The final deliverable is a conference-quality research paper (8-12 pages) in LaTeX suitable for submission to venues like NeurIPS, ICML, or ACL.

## How do you consider the project is success?

1. LaTeX paper compiles without errors and produces a properly formatted PDF (8-12 pages, two-column conference format)
2. Paper includes all required sections: abstract (150-250 words), introduction, related work, taxonomy/methodology, analysis & findings, discussion, conclusion, references
3. Taxonomy covers at least 30 benchmarks organized into 4-6 major categories with clear criteria
4. Paper includes 6-8 figures or tables (taxonomy visualization, coverage heatmap, correlation matrices, trend graphs)
5. Meta-analysis includes quantitative findings: correlation coefficients between benchmarks, coverage statistics, temporal trends (2020-2024)
6. References section contains 40+ citations to benchmark papers, evaluation methodology papers, and LLM papers
7. Discussion identifies at least 5 concrete coverage gaps or evaluation limitations with supporting evidence
8. Writing is clear, technical, and follows academic style — no obvious grammatical errors or formatting issues
