# Programming Language Adoption Study

## What do you want to build?

Write a research paper analyzing programming language adoption trends over a 10-year period using multiple data sources: Stack Overflow activity, GitHub repository statistics, and job posting trends. The study should identify adoption patterns, growth trajectories, and factors influencing language popularity.

The research should:
- Collect data from Stack Overflow (question counts, tags, view statistics), GitHub (repository counts, star trends, commit activity), and job boards (Stack Overflow Jobs archive, LinkedIn, Indeed APIs where available)
- Track 15-20 major languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Java, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Julia, R, etc.
- Analyze temporal trends (2014-2024): growth rates, adoption curves, peak popularity periods, decline phases
- Correlate language adoption with ecosystem factors: package ecosystem growth, tooling improvements, major framework releases, corporate backing
- Segment analysis by domain: web development, data science, systems programming, mobile development
- Use only publicly available data sources and APIs

The final deliverable is a conference-quality research paper (8-12 pages) in LaTeX suitable for submission to software engineering or empirical CS venues like ICSE, MSR, or EMSE.

## How do you consider the project is success?

1. LaTeX paper compiles without errors and produces a properly formatted PDF (8-12 pages, conference format)
2. Paper includes all required sections: abstract, introduction, methodology (data sources, collection methods, metrics), results, discussion, threats to validity, conclusion, references
3. Dataset covers 15+ languages across 10 years with documented data collection and cleaning procedures
4. Analysis includes time-series plots for each language showing normalized adoption trends across all three data sources
5. Paper includes 10-15 figures/tables: trend line graphs, growth rate comparisons, correlation matrices between data sources, domain-specific adoption heatmaps, year-over-year change charts
6. Statistical analysis identifies growth/decline patterns: computes CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), inflection points, and correlation between Stack Overflow activity and job demand
7. Discussion identifies 5-7 key factors influencing adoption: ecosystem maturity, corporate sponsorship, educational adoption, framework availability, performance characteristics
8. References section contains 30+ citations to programming language papers, empirical software engineering studies, and technology adoption research
